            <p>Hi, I’m <b>Jaada Sampath Kumar</b>, an enthusiastic undergraduate student from the Computer Science & Engineering (IoT) department at <a href="https://www.sphoorthyengg.ac.in/">Sphoorthy Engineering College</a>, Nadergul.</p>
            <p>I’m passionate about full-stack web development and love turning ideas into functional digital products. I recently developed a complete eCommerce website using React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, which helped me gain hands-on experience in building scalable web applications.
            Throughout my academic journey, I have explored and learned various programming languages including C, Python, and Java, and continue to sharpen my skills through projects and self-learning.</p>
            <p>Skills:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Languages: C, Python, Java</li>
                <li>Web Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js</li>
                <li>Database: MongoDB</li>
                <li>  Tools: Git, VS Code</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'm eager to learn new technologies and aim to pursue a career in software development, especially in areas like full-stack development, IoT solutions, and cloud technologies.

                When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring tech blogs, working on side projects, and staying updated with the latest in technology.</p>
